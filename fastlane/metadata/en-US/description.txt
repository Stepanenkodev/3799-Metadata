Rogue Merchant
Pack smarter. Earn bigger. Become a legendary adventurer.

Step into the boots of a treasure-hunting wanderer with one goal: collect as much loot as you can carry… literally. In Rogue Merchant, every level challenges you to make quick decisions, sort through piles of valuable items, and pack them tightly into your customizable backpack before time runs out.

Choose your items wisely—each has a coin value, rarity, and shape that determines how well it fits in your inventory. What you can’t fit, you leave behind. What you manage to pack becomes your reward.

Use your hard-earned coins to upgrade your skills, expand your inventory, and unlock new abilities like rerolls, locks, banishes, better trade value, extra time, and even improved luck for rare loot. Rearrange your backpack layout however you like to build the perfect system for maximum treasure efficiency.

Each adventure is split into two stages:
• Item Selection – Pick from sets of three randomized items while racing the timer, using rerolls or locks when needed.
• Packing – Fit everything into your 6×9 inventory grid before the countdown ends, rotate pieces, strategize, and hit “Escape” to claim victory.

Win, and your adventurer celebrates with a bursting backpack of coins. Lose, and… well, he won’t be as happy.
